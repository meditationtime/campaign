# Campaign
This serves as a brainstorm document, more to be added..

## Target audiences
People are either into contemplating or not at all, but everyone needs peace of mind.  Practicing meditation is a growth process and an introduction is often very valuable for those without any experience 
Feel free to add / suggest target audiences 

### Existing communities and teachers
Today we already have an active community around collective meditation.  Being able to easily communicate eachother's moments and join remotely when unable to attend will strengthen the group efforts.

### Newcomers
Never has the disrespect for our true nature been greater than today.  The act of contemplating is important to raise awareness of how we treat ourselves and our world.  Being able to tune in on topics and people that matter to you will help you a lot.
